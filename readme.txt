How to download and play:
 	-First, make sure your leap motion controller is plugged in and the drivers are installed.
1. First download the .zip file that was submitted via Brightspace.
2. Unzip folder.
3. To start the game, please click the 'HCI Project One' Application file in the folder.
4. The instructions are displayed on the screen after you click play with your desrired settings.
5. You can hit the balls against the backboard with your hands, or you can grab them, and attempt
to throw them at the backboard instead. The ramp surfaces are 'Slippery', so they slide faster into the 
center of the "court". 
6. You get 2 points per ball that hits the backboard. It IS possible to lose the balls by throwing them
out of control. To restart, just exit out, and go back up to step 3.

I used C# script to keep score during the game. It checks to see if the ball collides with the backboard, or hoop.

Possible addition to the game if I had more time:
better hit map for the ball and hoop colliders
more balls, and easier to pick them up
make a better color scheme with more decorations

I played around with a bunch of different things in this project like the materials, physics, collisions,
 controllers, different packages, and several other things. I really look forward to when my partner is done
  and I get the leap motion controller back to use again. 

Made using unity 3d
